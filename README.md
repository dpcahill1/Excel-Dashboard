# Location-Analysis-in-Excel
Working in a team of three, we designed and develop an interactive Excel dashboard to analyze and identify the best place to live in the US from a selected group of cities. Our goal was to create a user-friendly tool that anyone, regardless of skill level, could easily navigate to support their decision-making process. We collected, cleaned, and integrated data from over five sources, incorporating economic indicators, cost of living metrics, and even the best dining options in each city. Utilizing advanced Excel features such as dropdowns, slicers, and macros learned throughout our course, we created a dashboard that provides a comprehensive location-based analysis while remaining accesible to users of all experience levels.
